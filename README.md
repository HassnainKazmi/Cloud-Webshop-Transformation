## Database Schema: Snowflake Schema

### Why We Chose Snowflake Schema

We chose a **Snowflake Schema** for our database design because it:

1. Reduces redundancy and ensures data integrity through normalization.
2. Supports scalability by structuring data hierarchically.
3. Optimizes storage by avoiding duplicated data.
4. Enables accurate and flexible reporting for analytics.
5. Aligns closely with real-world relationships in our webshop.

This schema ensures our database is robust, maintainable, and ready to support future growth.
